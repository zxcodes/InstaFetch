# InstaFetch

A fun little project to scrape profile details from an Instagram account. I made this long ago while I was learning to Scrape the Web.

## How it works?

It uses Gazpacho Scraping Module to make the request as well as parse the markup received from it. We then further split the data using regex module and parse the content from it which finally gets printed out to the console.
